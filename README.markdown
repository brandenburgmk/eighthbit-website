EighthBit Website
=================

Requirements and Suggestions
----------------------------
   I've developed this using Django 1.1.1, however I am not opposed to making sure it works with the svn version of django. Any decent django host has at least 1.1.1 by now, so this is the minimum version I will support.
   The site will use LDAP to communicate with danopia/opersite and Atheme IRC Services.

Want to Contribute?
-------------------
   If you want to contribute just fork the repo, and submit a pull request. If we approve the changes, we will pull them in. Feel free to add yourself to the doc/CONTRIBUTERS file if you feel you've contributed a decent amount to the project.
